This is a file that explains about some of the projects i completed through project-based learning.

This may include documents OF DIFFERENT PROJECTS.

Mainly,
HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, REACT etc, which are the most basic and important skills to learn.

These projects are only-for beginner purposes. 

And these are proof of learning in public that i am learning through projects which is apparently the best way to learn.

A viewer can see my learning progress and can also learn from my mistakes. He/She can also learn from my code and start project-based learning.
